# Data-Science-Techniques

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive, structured benchmark of Data Science techniques, organized to reflect the end-to-end lifecycle of real-world data science projects. It was created using AI under my supervision based my Exprerience and understanding. 

It is designed to serve as:

- A reference repository for future consultation

- A learning and teaching resource

- A professional portfolio demonstrating methodological depth

- A practical guide aligned with industry best practices

Rather than focusing only on algorithms, this repository emphasizes decision-making, correctness, and business relevance.

## Repository Philosophy

This project is built on the following principles:

- Technique-first, not tool-first

Business relevance over academic abstraction

- Reproducibility and clarity

- Leakage-safe and production-aware workflows

- Incremental complexity (from fundamentals to advanced topics)

Every folder represents a conceptual block commonly encountered in real data science work.
