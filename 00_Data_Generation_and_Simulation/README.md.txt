# 00 – Data Generation and Simulation

This folder contains notebooks focused on synthetic data creation and
controlled experiments.

The goal is to understand how data properties such as missingness,
imbalance, noise, leakage, and drift affect preprocessing, modeling,
and evaluation.

All notebooks are designed to be:
- Reproducible
- Interpretable
- Reusable as benchmarking tools
